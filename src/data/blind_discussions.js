      "Since the [latest \"accessibility\" update to the Reddit app](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/14n9426/), the amount and magnitude of new accessibility related bugs has made it virtually impossible for blind mods to operate on mobile.\n\nWe have done absolutely everything we could to work with Reddit and have given them every opportunity. When they offered to host a demo of the update, we understood how little they understand about accessibility: [they did not respond to a request to use the app with screen curtain on](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/14n9426/comment/jq6tbxi/?context=3). The only fair conclusion is that they cannot use it without sight, but expect us to.\n\nThe update introduced various regressions and new bugs. This is entirely within the expectations of the mod team, given how rushed it was and how Reddit continues to demonstrate how underprepared they are to deal with accessibility.\n\n## But what about the \"accessibility apps?\"\n\nThey may not work. At this time, it is impossible to log into RedReader.\n\nThey shouldn't have to work. Reddit made a business decision to effectively remove users' access to third-party apps and must assure that access by its own means.\n\n## What now for r/Blind?\n\nThe subreddit will continue operating under the care and stewardship of its visually impaired and sighted moderators.\n\nLet us be clear: **r/Blind cannot be moderated by blind people.**\n\n## Reddit has a single path forward\n\nAs u/rumster, founder of r/Blind and a CPWA Certified Professional of Web Accessibility, told Reddit admins in our first meeting, Reddit needs to hire a CPWA. It has been patently obvious that the company does not have the know-how to address these accessibility issues, as we explained on [the update on the second meeting](https://www.reddit.com/r/Blind/comments/14ds81l/rblinds_meetings_with_reddit_and_the_current/).\n\nTo build the required internal structure and processes, and create an accessible platform, they must:\n\n* Create and fill the position of \"Chief Accessibility Officer.\" This role must have oversight over development as well as the ability to set internal and public Reddit policy. This person should have the ability to halt any corporate strategy or initiative within Reddit as a company and/or any feature, update, etc. to the Reddit website and/or apps until they believe the impact on accessibility for disabled redditors by said strategy, initiative, feature, update, etc. has been fully addressed, implemented,  ensured, and/or mitigated. The person filling this role should have both development and managerial  experience and hold at least the Certified Professional of Web Accessibility (CPWA) certification as issued by the International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP). This person should also be disabled and an active Redditor and must coordinate communication with disabled users and their communities.\n* Reddit must commit to ensuring training and certification of all developers responsible for accessible and inclusive design. Lead developers must be trained and certified at least to the level of Web Accessibility Specialist (WAS) as issued by the International Association of Accessibility Professionals (IAAP), but ideally should hold the \"Certified Professional of Web Accessibility (CPWA).\"\n* Fully implement an alternative text (alt text) function for photos and videos in which posters can compose descriptions for blind and visually impaired users.\n* Implement a closed-captioning system for videos, thus allowing deaf and deafblind Redditors full access to the audio content of videos.\n* Implement a single dedicated point of contact for accessibility and disability issues in the form of an email address: accessibility@reddit.com.\n* Ultimately and crucially, commit to comply with the [WCAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) at level AA and [ATAG](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/) standards.\n\n## Disability is a social issue and software must be tested\n\nAs u/MostlyBlindGamer explained to Reddit admins in modmail, \"disability\" is an interaction between a person's physical or mental characteristics and society's barriers. Your website's barriers. You are making people disabled by breaking your website and apps. Your organization's unwillingness and/or inability to hire actual experts is what's making people disabled. We're not disabled, because we can't see like you can: we're disabled, because crunching developers, who don't have the necessary training and experience, for a week, predictably, caused regressions. If I don't test my code, people die. When you don't test your code, because you don't know how to, you make people disabled.\n\n## If Reddit Inc wants to deny service to disabled people, they must make that statement\n\nAs [u/DHamlinMusic said](https://www.reddit.com/r/modnews/comments/14n9426/accessibility_updates_to_mod_tools_part_2/jq959sd), this update made no functional changes beyond the add/remove favorites button in the community's list being labeled and changing state properly, yet it added dozens of new issues, made moderating significantly harder and should never have been released to start. If Reddit's intention is to just not have disabled users on reddit come out and say it instead of pulling this landlord trying to empty a rent controlled building bullshit.\n\n**Disabled redditors will not accept being quietly whisked away, nor will the broader Reddit community. People make Reddit and people can break Reddit.**",

      "# Introduction\n\nIt's possible that those of you who are active on other subreddits may have read about the changes in pricing that Reddit has recently released for its API - the system apps use to get and send data from and to Reddit.  But for those of you who haven't, here's a summary.  On May 31, 2023, Reddit announced they were raising the price to make calls to their API from being free to a level that will kill every third party app on Reddit, from Apollo, to Dystopia, to Reddit for Blind, to Luna for Reddit, to BaconReader,. Even if you don't use any of those apps, this is a step toward killing other ways of customizing Reddit, such as the use of the old.reddit.com desktop interface.  This doesn't only impact your ability to access Reddit in a fluid, customizable, and efficient way; many of us on the mod team are also blind, and we depend on those third party apps to make sure that this community remains a safe, fun, and productive place.  Unfortunately, new Reddit, and the official Reddit apps, just don't provide us with the levels of accessibility we need in order to continue effectively running this community. As well, the Transcribers of Reddit, the many dedicated folks who volunteer to transcribe and describe thousands and thousands of images on Reddit, may also be unable to operate.  \n\nOne of our moderators, u/itsthejoker, has had multiple hour-long calls with various Reddit employees.  However, as of the current time, our concerns have gone unheard, and Reddit remains firm. That's why the moderation team of r/blind now feels that we have no choice but to take further action.  \n\n## The Subreddit Blackout\n\nThose of us who are blind are no strangers to the need for collective action.  From the protests that resulted in the ADA passing in the United States, to world-wide protests driving forward accessibility of some of the Internet's largest websites, collective action is a step our community has taken in the past, often with some success.  It is with a heavy heart that we come to you now, and say that it's time to bring this tool out of the toolbox once more.  \n\nIn solidarity with thousands of other subreddits who are impacted by this change, we will be shutting down the /r/blind subreddit for 48 hours from June 12th to June 14th.  You will not be able to read or make posts during that time.  Our Discord server will remain open, and we invite anyone who would like to interact with the /r/blind community to join us there.  If you’re not part of the /r/blind Discord server yet, you can join via the following link: [https://discord.com/invite/5kMEv7Sq9y](https://discord.com/invite/5kMEv7Sq9y)\n\n## How you can help\n\nWhile this issue has a profound impact on those of us who are blind and visually impaired, as with so many issues of accessibility and inclusivity, it impacts far more than just us.  If you'd like to get involved, you can find out what you can do to help at r/Save3rdPartyApps\\- or, if you moderate a subreddit, its sister sub r/ModCoord.  You can also join the Reddit-Blackout channel in the /r/blind Discord, where we will have resources you can use to contact media and other organizations, and keep everyone up to date with our on-going efforts in this matter.  \n\n## What comes next?\n\nIf this change to the Reddit API is not reversed, we are not convinced that we will be able to continue running the r/blind subreddit.  However, that doesn't mean the end of this wonderful, passionate, curious, helpful, and amazing community of folks.  We are continuing to explore our options, and create back-up plans.  We all want to remain on Reddit. Let's do what we can to make that a reality!  But if it turns out we can't, we want to reassure you that this isn't the end of our community.  So let’s focus on doing everything we can to make those possible back-up plans unnecessary.  \n\nThe r/blind mod team",

      "Moderators of r/blind—along with moderators in other communities who use assistive technologies and Reddit users with accessibility expertise—had a Zoom meeting with representatives at Reddit on Friday, June 16, 2023. While the call was promising in that Reddit invited us to be part of continuing dialog and demonstrated some well-conceived accessible designs for Reddit users, we came away with serious concerns which Reddit was either unable or unwilling to address during the meeting.\n\n* Reddit is currently prioritizing accessibility for users rather than for moderators, and representatives were unwilling to provide timelines by when Reddit’s moderation tools would be accessible for screen reader users. Further, Reddit representatives seemed unaware that blind moderators rely on third-party applications because Reddit’s moderation tools present significant accessibility challenges. They also seemed unaware that the apps which have so far received exemptions from API pricing do not have sufficient moderation functions. u/NTCarver0 explained that blind moderators will be unable to ensure safety for our communities—as well as for Reddit in general—without accessible moderation systems, and asked Reddit representatives how blind moderators were supposed to effectively moderate our communities without them. Reddit representatives deferred the question, stating they would have to take notes and get back with us. A fellow moderator, u/MostlyBlindGamer, also pointed out that blind moderators who are unable to effectively moderate the subreddit and thus will become inactive may be removed at Reddit’s discretion per policy, and that such removal would leave r/Blind with no blind moderators. Reddit representatives also deferred comment on this issue.\n* Reddit representatives refused to answer questions concerning the formal certifications, accreditations or qualifications of employees tasked with ensuring universal accessibility. These certifications demonstrate that a professional has the knowledge necessary to create universally-accessible software and/or documents. Because Reddit cannot confirm that employees tasked with universal accessibility hold appropriate certifications or that the company will provide for such training and certification, we have concerns that employees do not have the appropriate knowledge to effectively ensure access for all assistive technology users both at present and in the future. Reddit has also indicated there are not currently any employees who work full-time on accessibility. This is a necessity for any organization as large and influential as Reddit.\n* Reddit representatives had previously disclosed to r/Blind moderators that an accessibility audit had been performed by a third-party company, however they refused to answer questions as to what company performed the audit or how the audit was conducted. Answers to these questions would have allowed us to determine whether the audit was performed by an accredited organization known for credible and thorough work. Reddit also could not answer questions as to what assistive technologies, such as screen readers, screen magnifiers, dictation softwares, etc., were used during the audit. Bluntly, we cannot know the thoroughness or scope of the audit—and therefore the extent to which Reddit is aware of the accessibility barriers present in their website and apps—without this information.\n* During the previous meeting, Reddit representatives raised a question regarding perceived disparities between the accessibility of the iOS and Android apps, suggesting the audit did not confirm that the accessibility failings in the iOS app are much more severe than those present in the Android app. During the latest meeting, u/MostlyBlindGamer explained that the iOS app has no labels for the ubiquitous and essential upvote and downvote buttons while the Android app does. This question raises the concern that Reddit representatives may not have a full and actionable understanding of the issues at stake or, in fact, the exact accessibility failings in their apps.\n* Reddit representatives narrowly defined the scope of the latest meeting less than an hour ahead of it, explicitly excluding third-party apps and API pricing from the conversation. They did acknowledge that this made it difficult to adequately prepare for the meeting.\n* Reddit refused to define the term “accessibility-focused app,” alleging that this was outside  the scope of the meeting. This term is not industry-standard and was instead created when Reddit carved out an exemption in their upcoming API policies for third-party apps used by blind people to access the platform. Without this definition, we are unable to ascertain whether apps that have not been approved but are nevertheless relied upon by community members qualify for an exemption.\n* Reddit gave no firm commitments as to when accessibility improvements would be rolled out to the website or apps. However, it is obvious that the Reddit website and apps will not be ready for disabled users—and especially moderators—by July 1.\n\nIn general, moderators of r/Blind who attended the call came away with mixed impressions. Reddit seems to be somewhat aware of the myriad accessibility barriers present in their applications and website, and the company appears to be laying the groundwork to fix issues which they are aware of. This is excellent news. However, we also feel that Reddit does not know what it does not know, and this lack of knowledge is exasperating, disheartening, and exhausting. We also came away frustrated that Reddit representatives were either unwilling or unable to answer prudent and pertinent questions which would allow us to determine not only how we can best keep our community safe and healthy, but also whether Reddit is truly prepared to commit to ensuring accessibility for all disabled  users both now and in the future. Finally, we hope that our concerns—especially those pertaining to moderation—will be addressed expeditiously and satisfactorily, thus assuring that r/Blind can operate effectively well into the future. Despite our concerns, we remain open to continued dialog with Reddit in the hope that it will foster a more accessible platform.",

      "I only ever seem to see online and in real life to be honest, people that are just chill with being blind and go about their daily lives by adapting things but not feeling like they're particularly missing out too much. I know it's good to be positive, but I've heard all my life about how Blind people *can* do almost anything with a bit of help and adaptations. But I just feel like everything is so impossible. Only making this post to see if I'm the only one or not? I'm literally stuck in my house, despite having years and years of mobility training. I've learnt roots but still don't feel confident enough to do them on my own, I have no job and no idea of what I can/want to do, I just don't get how all other blind people just seem fine with it. Is there anyone else who has felt hopeless as  I do now and overcome it? What did you do? It's like we're always told there are services out there that can help us, but I don't even know how to go about finding those or how to contact anyone and ask for help. Like I'm very competent around the house, cooking and cleaning et cetera, but getting out and about anywhere I can't. ",

I am not happy with where I’m at in life and I am not happy with what’s going on in my life, but if I keep thinking and dwelling upon it, it’s just gonna drag me down more and more I’ve tried doing things about including talking to two different therapists that didn’t help But now, despite everything telling me not to do it, I went ahead and did it, and I went ahead and went to school for the blind, which is where I’m currently at so I can become a better version of myself as much as I hate coming here just because I’m just shy and introverted. I also love it because I am now forced to do things. I would’ve never done before \n\nPart of the reason that you feel this way as you’re scared and I totally understand that trust me I never wanted to take the bus, but I’m forced to and now I still hate it, but I do it anyways so you mentioned you have ONM skills so why not put them to the test why not use them and why not making it a easy challenge for yourself This is something I dare you to do something I challenge you to do and if it’s something you’re not comfortable with that’s fine or something you don’t wanna do as far as like taking the bus. That’s also fine but here’s what I propose \n\nCorrect me if I’m wrong, but it seems like you have access to your local bus system, which is something a whole lot of us desire and crave for I want you to find something to eat. That’s let’s say a mile away something you can easily take the bus to which would take literally five minutes on a bus and if you chicken out on the way back, you can always walk back wow not desirable. You could still do it. It’s just a mile Choose something good maybe a burger place a Thai food place or how about even some pasta \n\nI challenge you and go there and once you go there, you actually have a nice reward which will be some good food Once you get this done and you get back home somethings gonna happen Your mind is gonna be blown because you got something done and it’s something you stepped out of your comfort zone for and I totally get it. You were nervous the whole time, but you were never really more than a mile away from home so this will help you build your confidence and your level of comfort with actually doing things like this \n\nI’ll use a quick example from my current life as I am currently in school we have these things called drop routes and they basically drop you off somewhere randomly and you have to make your way back to the bus stop so you can get back to school and you aren’t allowed to use your phone Let me tell you something. It is a terrifying as it sounds but once you get past your second and third one it’s actually fun I discovered something about my self that day.  I did some thing I didn’t think I could do or at the very least I knew I could do, but I didn’t wanna do but once I didn’t and once I got comfortable with it, it’s like a whole New World opened up for me,",

It has less to do with being blind, and has more to do with your unwillingness to work within your present situation And evolve your current perspective on life. I know that sounds harsh, but I'm literally saying this to you as somebody who feels like they've missed out on a lot of life because of many things, blindness being one of them, or at least my perception of my own blindness being one of them, and I've really been working to change that over the past couple of years.\n \nLook does being blind suck sometimes, and sometimes a lot of the time? Yes. But there's literally nothing we can do about it except adapt and continue to face it. And trust me I am all too familiar with the demons of depression and anxiety that can make this seemingly impossible. But depression and anxiety are pernicious. Anxiety makes you think that you should be avoiding the things that trigger it, and depression makes you think you're unable to do things because of it. Start small. Set reasonable goals for yourself, and slowly, ever so slowly, push yourself into new and changing comfort zones. There will be hiccups along the way but moving on in spite of them is exactly where you want to be for example, take maybe the easiest route you know and walk that route to and from your house. Or if there's a destination along that route, pick that destination and go there even if it's just to grab a cup of coffee Just do something simple. I promise, you got this. yes it is harder to control our inclusion in a society that's not necessarily built for us, but that doesn't mean we have to be beaten into submission and non-participation. Get out there and make those ill informed an uneducated sighted people uncomfortable. You deserve to be living a fulfilling life.",

      "EDIT: POSSIBLE SOLUTION?\n\nHow about I get rid of the map.  \nInstead I make a whole list of audio files called \"600\",\"261\", \"120\" , etc, and upload them in a file on her ipad.\n\nShe solves 20x3=600  \nOpens the audio file called \"600\". Listens to \"go to the tree near the football field\".  \nI print an A3 blue poster with her next clue and hang it on the tree.  \n12 x 2 =24 and she opens the file called 24. So on and so forth.\n\nThat works right? Please say that works\n\n\\-------------\n\nI am a maths teacher.\n\nI've just planned a scavenger hunt. The gist of it if they have a map of the school grounds. A bunch of numbers are written on it. I give them a multiplication , say 200x3, they look for 600 on the map, go there, and they'll find the next clue with another equation to solve on it. So on and so forth until they find a clue that says \"LAST ONE!!!\" they come back to me and if they have the correct numbers, bingo they win.\n\nI have three scavenger hunts with the clues written on different colours, which will allow the lowest achieving kids to complete it and the highest achieving kids not to be bored by unchallenging work.\n\nMy problem is adapting this for Anna\\*. Anna is halfway blind. I don't know the specifics of her condition but she needs to stick her nose on the paper in order to read it. She can pick a book from a shelf, but only by almost touching it with her face. She's also about 5 years behind in mathematics. She would definitely be doing the easiest hunt. My concerns are :\n\n\\- The map : even if I print larger like I usually do, it'll be too hard for her because she needs to stick her nose on it. She won't be able to see the 'whole picture' and make sense of the map  \n\\- Even if she does, the point of a scavenger hunt is to look for the clues. Therefore they have to be hidden. If they're not hidden, it's boring, if they're hidden she won't find them.  \n\\- She's terrible in group work. If I make teams, even if I pair her with someone weak, I just know she'll do nothing and just follow quietly.\n\nDoes anyone have any idea on how to adapt this for her?\n\nThanks for any advice\n\nEdited for language.",

This would also help with her learning search patterns.\n\nIf making things larger doesn't help, another tactic is to go tactile. Do you have access to Lego? You can use a bunch of baseplates and make the map out of Lego. That would have her feel it rather than see, and you can use different parts (flat parts versus studs) to mean different things. If you are willing to sacrifice some Lego pieces, you can even glue some materials on (like a pipe cleaner or other material as landmarks). So maybe she needs to find the fuzzy piece that is hidden in an area.",

Wikki Stix that you press on the lines of the map, gem stickers that get placed at points of interest, etc. (Cheaper alternative to Wikki Stix if you have the time is to draw a thick line of glue along the line, then let it sit for an hour - it takes longer than you think it will. This requires a steady hand.)\n\nDownsides: If the kids are supposed to run around with the map, the arts and crafts 3-D map will not last. Also, if the kid has never even seen or used a 3-D map, it will probably be hard to orient her. \n\n2. Digital map. Requires her to have access to a device (iPhone, iPad), and to be familiar with the screen reader tool VoiceOver. If this applies to you, I can talk through the process for setting this up.\n\n3. Have an extra step to the lesson where the kids build their own maps? Where they have to \"survey\" the area, maybe take measurements, and draw up their own map. Then you provide them info on where the clues are after they build it. This gives Anna a chance to familiarize herself with the area, while extending the task out, and demonstrating the benefit of good measurements or something.\n\n  \nClues Options:\n\n1. Provide enough information in the scatter hunt that you can get the person in finding range of the object (Like, they figure out they need to find something on a tree, so they know to look around a tree.)\n\n2. Attach clues to something that makes noise (like a wind chime, bell, or some kind of speaker). Ideally the noise makers would be consistent - that if you learn to look for the bell, all the clues are at bells, and there are no bells that aren't clues.\n\n3. Hot/Cold. You or another person who knows where things are located can tell her, like \"You're 10 feet away. You're 5 feet away. You're 10 feet away. You're out of range.\" She still has to wander around and look for things, you're just using a person to make it accessible.\n\n\n\nGroup Work Options:\n\n1. Give everyone in the group a different task that they're responsible for. (One person is the navigator, one person is the clue searcher, one person is the note taker / reporter, something like that.)\n\n2. You group up with Anna.",
